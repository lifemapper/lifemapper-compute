# Purpose: Fetch climate data for seeding named in SCENARIO_PACKAGE  
# Note that the CSV file must be created with URLs that will be sent by a 
#   server within jobs.  The server creates jobs identifying layers by
#   metadataUrls - these must be the same as those used in the seeding CSV 
#   file.  
# Here we are using data present on the server, so we create a CSV file after
#   the database is initialized.
