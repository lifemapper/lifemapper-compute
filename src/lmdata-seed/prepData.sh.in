# Purpose: Fetch climate data for seeding named in SCENARIO_PACKAGE_SEED  
# Note that the included CSV file must be created with shasums that will be sent by a 
#   server within jobs.  The server creates jobs identifying layers by
#   shasums - these must be the same as those used in the seeding CSV file.
